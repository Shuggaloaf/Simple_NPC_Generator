# Shuggaloaf's Simple NPC Generator

A System Agnostic NPC Generator for use in Foundry VTT.

There are other NPC Generators out there that offer much more robust features, including even creating an actor for you. My generator is not meant to compete with those. In fact, this was made fo my personal use but several people have reached out asking for it. So a module is the simplest way to provide the macro and all the tables used. 

You are probably like myself - way too many modules installed. If you'd like to, you may delete/disable the module after importing the macro and tables. Once those are imported into your game, they will remain. Of course you will have to check this Github repo to see if there are updates, but I do not expect there to be many if any. 

The maro opens a dialog with options for several (not all) races/sexes. Here is a sample of how the macro works:
