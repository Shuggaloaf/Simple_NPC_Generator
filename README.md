# Shuggaloaf's Simple NPC Generator

A System Agnostic NPC Generator for use in Foundry VTT.

There are other NPC Generators out there that offer much more robust features, including even creating an actor for you. My generator is not meant to compete with those. To me, those work great for pre-game use when you're creating more impactful NPCs

So why did I make this? Because I find that 95% of the time that I need a random NPC name/description is during gameplay. I need that info quickly. I don't have time to stop the game for several minutes while I set  options to create an NPC actor. And for most of those NPCs, I don't really want/need an actor anyway. I just need a quick name and a vague description quickly so I can keep the game going. If the NPC becomes impactful, I can make a more "permanent" NPC after the session.

To be honest I just made this for my personal use. It's not fancy, there are few bells and whistles, but it gets the job done quickly and without a lot of fuss. However since several people have reached out asking for it, I decided a module is the simplest way to provide the macro and all the tables used. 

Speaking of modules, you are probably like myself - way too many modules installed. If you'd like to, you may delete/disable the module after importing the macro and tables. Once those are imported into your game, they will remain. Of course you will have to check this Github repo to see if there are updates, but I do not expect there to be many.

The macro opens a dialog with options for several (not all) races/sexes. Here is a sample of how the macro works:

# To Do List
Note: These may be added at some point but I am in little hurry to do so. If anyone would like to provide me a list of names, or better yet, a JSON export of a FVTT table already setup for names, I'd gladly accept them and appreciate the help.

Need to create name tables for the following:
- Dragonborn
- Orc
- Tiefling
- Others? (Goblin, etc.)

Although I don't want actor creation to be a focus, I could see a case for a non-intrusive button within the chat message that when clicked would create an actor. Just for those times when the NPC does become more of a "regular". I do not believe this would be difficult, but need to look into it. Anyone willing to submit an example of code to do so, feel free to open an issue.
